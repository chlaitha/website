  abstract = {Advances in agricultural data production provide ever-increasing opportunities for pushing the research frontier in agricultural economics and designing better agricultural policy. As new technologies present opportunities to create new and integrated data sources, researchers face tradeoffs in survey design that may reduce measurement error or increase coverage. In this chapter, we first review the econometric and survey methodology literatures that focus on the sources of measurement error and coverage bias in agricultural data collection. Second, we provide examples of how agricultural data structure affects testable empirical models. Finally, we review the challenges and opportunities offered by technological innovation to meet old and new data demands and address key empirical questions, focusing on the scalable data innovations of greatest potential impact for empirical methods and research.},

  abstract = {Two sources of respondent bias introduce measurement error into household statistics: asymmetric information between the proxy respondent and the individual on whom they report; and aggregation bias when a proxy respondent reports on a household-level outcome across multiple individuals. We estimate the effects of respondent biases in a survey experiment in Burkina Faso by varying who reports on the agricultural production of household members. We find respondent biases are not solely attributable to asymmetric information. Choosing a household head proxy lowers aggregation biases, but results in both over and under-estimates of agricultural variables relative to random proxies. Random proxies systematically under report agricultural statistics. Self-reporting protocols increase enumerator work days by only 5\% indicating a high bias-cost tradeoff in choosing proxy response over self-reports. Survey designers should weight whether proxy bias magnitude or direction of bias are more significant threats to parameter estimation when determining their proxy response protocol.},

  abstract = {This paper assesses the relationship between the length of recall and nonrandom error in agricultural survey data. Using data from LSMS-ISA surveys in Malawi and Tanzania, we show that key input and output variables are systematically related to the length of the recall period, indicating the presence of nonrandom measurement error. With longer recall periods, farmers report higher quantities of harvest, labor and fertilizer inputs. Farmers list fewer plots as the recall period increases. We argue that it is plausible that farmers over-estimate plot-level outcomes \textendash{} harvest, labor and fertilizer inputs \textendash{} while it is also plausible that they forget some of their more marginal plots as their memory decays due to longer recall periods. We find evidence of measurement error related to the length of recall also in common measures of agricultural productivity. The size of the recall effect typically varies between 2 and 5 percent per additional month of recall length, making its impact on the reliability of key agricultural indicators, including SDG indicator 2.3, economically significant. With data reliability affecting policy effectiveness, improving agricultural survey data quality remains an important concern, especially in light of the ambitious 2030 agenda reflected in the Sustainable Development Goals. Mainstreaming objective measures where possible and reducing the risk of recall error through shorter recall periods appear to be promising avenues to improve the quality of key variables in agricultural surveys.},
